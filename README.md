# js-app1-pokedex
Task #2: Created a variable with 3 objects. Each object has 3 keys: name, height, and array of types.
Task #3: for part one, I created a for loop to write the names of the Pokemons and their height next to their names. 
and for part 3 I created a for loop with an if condistion to list all the names and the heights and label the one with the tallest height as "wow, that's big!"
